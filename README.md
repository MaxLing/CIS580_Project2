Given consecutive images and their feature data, Milestone 3 achieve the Structure from Motion Pipeline. It involves epipolar RANSAC, Essential Matrix decomposition, linear/nonlinear Triangulation, PnP RANSAC, linear/nonlinear PnP and Bundle Adjustment with Jacobian.

The result and visualization suggest the reprojection error is gradually minimized in the pipeline.
